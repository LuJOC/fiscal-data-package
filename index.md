title: Budget Data Package
---

Budget Data Package is a simple, open technical specification for government
budget and spending data.

It is **lightweight** and **user-oriented** specification which aims to be
**extremely easy to use** both for those publishing data (e.g. governments) and
for those wanting to use the data (such as researchers and journalists).

    The spec contains a full RFC-style specification

## Additional Materials

[`schema.json`][schema] contains a [JSON schema][schema] for Budget Data
Package metadata.

Note: this JSON schema only specifies the basic structure of the metadata
descriptor. It does not check fine-grained properties like the required fields
associated with different dataset types, and it does not specify the
well-formedness of CSV datasets.
