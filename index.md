title: Fiscal Data Package
---

Fiscal Data Package is an open technical specification for government budget
and spending data. It is a lightweight and user-oriented specification,
intended to eliminate the technical friction experienced by researchers and
journalists working with existing financial data.

## Getting started

The [Specification](spec/) contains a full RFC-style specification for the Fiscal Data Package format.

[`schema.json`][schema] contains a [JSON schema][schema] for Fiscal Data
Package metadata. Note: this JSON schema only specifies the basic structure of
the metadata descriptor. It does not check fine-grained properties like the
required fields associated with different dataset types, and it does not
specify the well-formedness of CSV datasets.

[schema]: /schema.json

## Contributing

Fiscal Data Package is an open specification. Development of the specification
is in the hands of its community of usersâ€”including data producers,
intermediaries, and consumers.
