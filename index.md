title: Fiscal Data Package
---

Fiscal Data Package is a simple, open technical specification for government
budget and spending data.

It is **lightweight** and **user-oriented** specification which aims to be
**extremely easy to use** both for those publishing data (e.g. governments) and
for those wanting to use the data (such as researchers and journalists).

## Additional Materials

[`fiscal-data-package.json`][schema] (hosted in the [dataprotocols/schemas repository](https://github.com/dataprotocols/schemas)) contains a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) for Fiscal Data Package metadata.

Note: this JSON schema only specifies the basic structure of the metadata
descriptor. It does not check fine-grained properties like the required fields
associated with different dataset types, and it does not specify the
well-formedness of CSV datasets.

## Contributing

Fiscal Data Package is an open specification. Development is led by Open
Knowledge in collaboration with the World Bank and GIFT, the Global Initiative
on Fiscal Transparency.

Development closely involves the community of users -- including data producers,
intermediaries, and consumers.
