# Contributing to Budget Data Package

The creators of the first draft of Budget Data Package are in the process of formalizing the open development process that will be used for future revisions of the specification. **A future version of this document will describe this process.**

The Budget Data Package specification will be open to contributions from its entire community of users. Approval of contributions to the specification will be the responsibility of a set of maintainers and moderators drawn from the community. The initial set will be determined through consultation with the budget data community; future maintainers will be chosen by the specification's users through a democratic process **as yet not determined**.
