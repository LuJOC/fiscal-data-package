# Fiscal Data Package

Fiscal Data Package is an open technical specification for government budget and spending data. It is a lightweight and user-oriented specification, intended to eliminate the technical friction experienced by researchers and journalists working with existing financial data.

## Getting started

`specification.md` contains a full RFC-style specification for the Fiscal Data Package format.

`schema.json` contains a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) for Fiscal Data Package metadata. Note: this JSON schema only specifies the basic structure of the metadata descriptor. It does not check fine-grained properties like the required fields associated with different dataset types, and it does not specify the well-formedness of CSV datasets.

## Contributing

Fiscal Data Package is an open specification. Development of the specification is in the hands of its community of usersâ€”including data producers, intermediaries, and consumers.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for information about the development and feedback process for the specification.
