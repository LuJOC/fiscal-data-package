# Budget Data Package

Budget Data Package is an open technical specification for government budget and spending data. It is a lightweight and user-oriented specification, intended to eliminate the technical friction experienced by researchers and journalists working with existing financial data.

This repository contains the current version of the Budget Data Package spec. 

## Getting started

`specification.md` contains a full RFC-style specification for the Budget Data Package format.

A shorter overview of the spec is available [as a Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16H75ZTtNBBVo6QEuM0YPiMch8UeF1nqASVJFwu-eDMM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Contributing

Budget Data Package is an open specification. Development of the specification is in the hands of its community of usersâ€”including data producers, intermediaries, and consumers.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for information about the development and feedback process for the specification.
